# Retropie RPX Utils

Retropie RPX Utils are a collection of utilities I felt were missing from Retropie. The aim of these utilities are to provide more modern console features to a Retropie based system.

Some of these features include:

- System Level Screenshots
- Ingame System Menu (Pauses Game)
- Notification Overlay 

The reason for making these tools are to enhance the user experience for a custom handheld I've been developing, [RP3P](https://github.com/hypertacos520/RP3P-Handheld). More features may be added based on the needs of that particular project.
